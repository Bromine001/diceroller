Hi!
You built this simple descent dice roller in FEB of 15.
designed a. for practicing Javascript and b. for playing descent with more than a couple people.
it's built mainly for use on a mobile screen, thus the small sizes and small images and such.

-- I included coding for various attacks with green dice, though mostly commented them out or
    left the actual button blank, as we arent' using green dice. 

-- Used plain Javascript.

-- Practiced using CSS media queries.

-- Horizontal view built using Sass.
